# Hey there, I'm Faran Inam! 👋

I'm a frontend developer who genuinely loves bringing web interfaces to life. My goal is always to build clean, responsive, and really user-friendly experiences. I'm constantly learning and diving deeper into the core technologies that make the web tick.

# A Little About Me 💡

What I'm Focusing On Now: I'm really digging into JavaScript right now, and I'm excited about creating more interactive user interfaces.

Where I'm Headed: Eventually, I'd love to become a full-stack developer – building both the front and back ends of applications.

How I Learn Best: For me, nothing beats learning by doing! I love building small projects and sharing what I'm working on.

# My Go-To Tools & Skills 💻

Languages I Speak: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+ and growing!)

Concepts I'm Mastering: Making interfaces dynamic with DOM Manipulation, and ensuring everything looks good on any device with Responsive Design.

 My Workspace Essentials: VS Code, GitHub, and Live Server for quick previews.

# Projects I've Been Building 🚀

Here are a couple of projects where I've been putting my skills into practice:

To-Do List App: A simple, stylish little app to help keep track of daily tasks.

Check out the Demo! https://faraninam.github.io/To-Do-List/

Color Picker: A handy web tool for picking colors and grabbing their HEX codes.

(I've always got more ideas brewing, so stay tuned for new projects!)
